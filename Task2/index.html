          <strong>Family and early years</strong>
          <br>
          Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born on February 17, 1963 in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York, he is the son of Deloris (née Peoples),
           who worked in banking, and James R. Jordan, Sr., an equipment supervisor. His family moved to Wilmington, 
           North Carolina when he was a toddler.ordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career
            by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year; at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team.
          Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team, and tallied some 40-point games.
          As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points, after averaging 27 ppg, 12 rebounds ,and six assists per game (apg) for the season.Jordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina,

          <strong>Professional career</strong>
          <br>
          <u>Chicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998)
            Early NBA years (1984–1987)</u>
          <br>
          The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and 
          Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were
          in need of a center. Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a
           matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.
          Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.

        <u>Pistons roadblock (1987–1990)</u>
        Jordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting,
        and he won his first league MVP Award. He was also named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, as he averaged 1.6 blocks per game (bpg),
        a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg), and led the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league.
        The Bulls finished 50–32, and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they 
        defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more 
        experienced Detroit Pistons, who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the "Bad Boys"
